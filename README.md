# Selenium Learning Journey with Eclipse IDE and Java as Language

Welcome to the **Selenium Learning Journey** repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting the code and projects developed during the learning journey with Selenium, using Eclipse as the IDE, Java as the programming language, and Maven for project management.

## Introduction

Selenium is a widely used open-source framework for automating web applications. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository aims to be a comprehensive resource for tracking progress, storing code snippets, and showcasing achievements in Selenium automation using Eclipse, Java, and Maven.

## Repository Structure

- **src/test/java**: Store your Selenium code snippets organized by learning modules or topics.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Selenium with Eclipse, Java, and Maven, consider following these steps:

1. **Install Eclipse**:
   - Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).

2. **Set Up Selenium in Eclipse**:
   - Open your Maven project in Eclipse.
   - Navigate to the `pom.xml` file and add the Selenium WebDriver dependencies. Here's an example:

     ```xml
     <dependencies>
         <dependency>
             <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
             <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
             <version>3.141.59</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
         </dependency>
     </dependencies>
     ```

     Ensure that the version number matches the latest version available.

   - Save the `pom.xml` file, and Maven will automatically download the required Selenium WebDriver JAR files.

3. **Write Selenium Code**:
   - In your test directory (`src/test/java`), create Java classes for your Selenium test scripts.
   - Import the necessary Selenium packages, configure the WebDriver, and start writing your test logic.

Feel free to customize these steps based on your specific project setup and preferences.
